That's a great question about the fundamental structure of a Nuclei template. Based on the template in the Canvas, certain lines are always mandatory for a template to be valid and functional.

The following fields are considered essential:

id: This is a unique identifier for the template. Nuclei uses it for tracking, identification, and can use it to exclude or include specific checks. It must be unique across all templates you are running.

YAML
id: api-documentation-exposure
 info: This block contains metadata about the template. Within info, the following fields are mandatory:

name: A human-readable name for the template.
author: The person or team who created the template.
severity: The severity of the finding (e.g., info, low, medium, high, critical).
```yaml
info:
  name: Exposed API Documentation (Swagger UI / Redoc)
  author: Gemini
  severity: low
````

A Protocol Block (e.g., http, dns, file, tcp): You must have at least one protocol block that defines the actual logic of the template. For web checks, this is the http block. Inside this block, you need to define the request and how to process the response. For a minimal http request, you would typically need:

method: The HTTP method to use (e.g., GET, POST).
path: The path to request.
matchers: At least one matcher to define the condition for a successful finding.

```yaml
http:
  - method: GET
    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}" # A minimal path
    matchers:
      - type: status # A minimal matcher
        status:
          - 200
```
