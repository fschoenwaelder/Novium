# Retire.js

This add-on includes a passive scan rule which implements checks provided by [Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/) in order to identify vulnerable or out-dated JavaScript packages.

**Note:** The Risk level associated with Alerts raised by this scan rule are mapped to the severity ratings provided in the Retire.js data. If no severity is matched then a default of Medium Risk is used.
