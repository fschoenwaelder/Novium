# Novium - A automated Web Vulnerability Scanner
This project provides a proof-of-concept approach  to identifying potential weaknesses in web applications by generating and executing targeted scan plans. This tool uses Selenium to analyse a given web application domain, generating custom Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool templates for ZAP and Nuclei.

## Features
* **Intelligent Scan Plan Generation**: Leverages Google Gemini to analyze web scraping results and user-provided context to generate ZAP and Nuclei scan templates.
* **Automated Scanning**: Integrates with ZAP and Nuclei to run the generated scan plans against the target URL.
* **Vulnerability Reporting**: Parses scan reports from ZAP and Nuclei to present identified findings.
* **Virtual Environment Enforcement**: Ensures the script runs within a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively.

## Prerequisites
Before running this tool, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
* Python 3.9+: The script is developed and tested with Python 3.9 and above.
* ZAP: Download and install ZAP. The script expects the zap.sh executable (or equivalent for your OS) to be accessible.
* Nuclei: Install Nuclei.
* Google Gemini API Key: You will need a Google Gemini API key to use this tool. Set the GEMINI_API_KEY in the .env file.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
It's crucial to run this script within a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

(On Windows, use .\venv\Scripts\activate or venv\Scripts\activate.bat)

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The script is executed from the command line and requires a target URL.
```bash
python main.py -u <TARGET_URL> [OPTIONS]
```

### Arguments
| Flag (short) | Flag                  | Required/Optional | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```-u```     | ```--url```           | Required          | The target URL to scan (e.g., https://example.com)                                                                                               |
| ```-sc```    | ```--scrape```        | Optional          | If set, the script will scrape the target URL first. The scraped content will then be used by Gemini to identify potential weaknesses.           |
| ```-c```     | ```--context```       | Optional          | Provide additional context about the website to Gemini. This can help Gemini generate more relevant scan templates.                              |
| ```-as```    | ```-automatic-scan``` | Optional          | If set, after generating the ZAP and Nuclei templates, the script will automatically initiate scans using ZAP and Nuclei on the provided target. |
| ```-v```     | ```--verbose```       | Optional          | Enable verbose output for more detailed logging.                                                                                                 |

## Examples
Scrape and generate scan templates, then perform automatic scan:
```bash
python main.py -u https://example.com -sc -as
```

Provide context and generate scan templates (without scraping or automatic scan):
```bash
python main.py -u https://www.example.com -c "This is a login page for an e-commerce application."
```

Generate templates and perform automatic scan with verbose output:
```bash
python main.py -u https://demo.testfire.net -as -v
```
